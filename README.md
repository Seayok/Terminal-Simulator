.in and .out files will be in e2e_tests
.out files are expected stdout when stdin of the program is .in files with similar name

I also create a test.sh so that it will be easier to inspect output the program manually with a prettified form of the output.
To run the script:
1/ Current working directory is the one contains nautilus.py
2/ Run e2e_tests/Scripts_And_Pretty_Output/test.sh
3/ Pretty ouput will be generated inside Pretty_Output folder
